Introducing *BERNIE’s BULLDOG*
As part of a bi-yearly “Game Jam” type event held at the University Of Northampton, We were challenged to make a multiplayer video game for the famous Northampton Saints Rugby team’s Jumbotron. 

Select your character from four players from the Saint's Rugby team, and get to the other side of the pitch each time with increasing difficulty. Caught players will join Bernie's team as AI and help the mascot catch the remaining players.

Local multiplayer requires 2 controllers to function.


Versions:

WebGL - Single Player & Multiplayer Included (play in Full Screen)
